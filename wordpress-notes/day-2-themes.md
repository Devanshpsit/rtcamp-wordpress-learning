# WordPress Themes – Day 2

## What is a Theme?
A WordPress theme controls the design, layout, and appearance of a website.

## Where themes live
Themes are stored inside:
wp-content/themes/

## Common Theme Files
- style.css (theme information and styles)
- index.php (main template file)
- functions.php (theme functionality)
- header.php (site header)
- footer.php (site footer)

## Theme vs Plugin
- Theme controls appearance
- Plugin adds functionality

## Goal
To understand theme structure before creating a custom theme.
